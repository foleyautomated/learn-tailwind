# Setup Using:
`npm init -y` creates package.json
`npm install i -D tailwindcss`
`npx tailwindcss init` Creates tailwind config
`npm run build` executes the command in package.json/scripts/build. This script then uses the Tailwind CLI to convert the content of "input.css" (which  houses things like directives) and translates it into 'input.css'

# Use Via: 
`npm run watch` same as `npm run build` but "watches" so it can reload on change.
